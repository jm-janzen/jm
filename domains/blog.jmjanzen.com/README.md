# The Blog

I finally did it. I made <a href="https://blog.jmjanzen.com">The Blog</a>. The
blog that everyone puts off, until one day they stop putting it off. Well, of
those, this is mine.

It's got:

- No RSS
- No CSS
- No CMS

It's delightfully sloppy and manual, will lots of room for improvement and
(over) engineering. If you're reading this and think *hey if this guy can make
his blog, maybe I can make __my blog__*. Well, yes you can. If you're looking
for a place to start, look at 278d14e, and 0950b0d.

But even better, just start serving an `index.html` file somewhere and start
adding to it--figure out how to serving it smoother later, then write about it.
