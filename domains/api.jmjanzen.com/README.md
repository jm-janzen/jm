# JM's main api

The rough idea is to make a RESTful API of *me*. Yeah, it's a bit kooky, and I'm not sure what part I'd give the general public write access to, but it should be fun to try.

I'll probably add some better docs on the main website eventually, but just hit [api.jmjanzen.com/](https://api.jmjanzen.com/me/1) for an example of what I'm going for. See, my thought process is that--since I have struggled so much with what kind of identity to use for my "official" web presence--that I should present this "modality" (the different `id`s) in my public facing websites and services.

It's still evolving, and not actually fully RESTful yet, but you've got to admit making an API of yourself sounds pretty fun, right? You should do it, too. :)
