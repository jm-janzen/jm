    h2.content-subhead about this place
    p Welcome to the personal homepage of <abbr title='Pronounced "J.M."'>JM</abbr> Janzen - that's me; I'm JM, and I'm the webmaster around these here parts. Got a problem with it? That's cool. I don't have a problem with you, so enjoy your stay.

    p For the curious, see the <a href="https://github.com/jm-janzen/jm">source repo</a> for this website (in a nutshell: <a href="https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin">gin-gonic/gin</a> as a router, and some Ace templates). Some version of this website has been going since 2016. You can find the earliest version, trapped in amber and running at <a href="https://old.jmjanzen.com/">old.jmjanzen.com</a>. Isn't that timer cute? And check out that background -- that's the git log of the commits that went into making the website. I remember being pretty chuffed about that hahaa.

    p So back to this place. I'm working on injecting a bit more personality into this current version, but it's a process of a lifetime.

    p So yeah, like every personal homepage this one is under construction. (Please try not to trip over any üößÔ∏è signs you might find.)

    h2.content-subhead i hate this website

    p Having a website tied to your IRL name is a bit of a drag for an overthinker like me. I can't help but wonder about the various audiences that might visit: Family and friends, internet randos<sup>&dagger;</sup>, co-workers, prospective employers??

    p So just <abbr title="For Your Information">FYI</abbr> that I do have an actual personality beyond software development and being a diligent worker<sup>&Dagger;</sup>, it's just that maybe a <s>glorified business card</s> personal "brand" (ü§ÆÔ∏è) website might not be the best place for expressing that.

    p. But I'm trying. I actually love this website, and am slowly turning it into something to be proud of.

        <sup>&Dagger;</sup> Note to prospective employers that I am indeed a brilliant and diligent worker. In fact the <em>most</em> diligent of all workers! Please ignore the lies of the others.
