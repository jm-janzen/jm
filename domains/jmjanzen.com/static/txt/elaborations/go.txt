I like Go because 1) it reminds of C++, but without the baggage, and 2) because it's a lot of fun to write in. Actually, I don't think I've had as much fun since I was first getting into Ruby.

I'm still actively learning it, so every time I use it I seem to grok some new lesson. But the main one is to embrace simplicity and straightforwardness, which I get down with so hard.
